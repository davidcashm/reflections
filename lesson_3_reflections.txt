When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - Multiple contributors
 - Allows work from any machine
 - Backup in case computer is lost or damaged

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - Avoid pulling conflicting changes from others
 - Stability during testing

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 - Fork: Create a new repository out of an old one on Github
   - Useful when you want separate owners for the new and old project
   - Irrevocable (I think).  I.e. use it when you'll never want to merge them back together
 - Clone: Create a local copy of the repository
   - The normal operation to work on a github repository locally
 - Branch: Create a (possibly temporary) branch within the repository
   - Used for different versions of the code within a repository - e.g. prototypes, stable release branches, etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 - Lets you see differences between your local version and remote version, merge more gradually if desired

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 - Email

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 - Reasons mentioned before (prototype, etc.).  And in order to do a pull request?

git remote : List remote repositories for the current project
git remote add origin git@github.com:davidcashm/reflections.git
git push origin master : Push the master commit into "origin" remote
git pull origin master : Pull from the origin to update local master
git fetch : Pull from origin, and create a new local branch called origin/master to reflect it.  Following up with "git merge master origin/master" is then equivalent to git pull

How to make a pull request:
    - Make a new branch, and commit on the new branch
    - git push origin my-new-branch
    - On the github website, go to the new branch, and click on pull request

Typically, origin is my github repository, and "upstream" is the original repository that I forked from.

git pull upstream master : to pull in the master
