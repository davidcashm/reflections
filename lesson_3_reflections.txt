When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - Multiple contributors
 - Allows work from any machine
 - Backup in case computer is lost or damaged

git remote : List remote repositories for the current project
git remote add origin git@github.com:davidcashm/reflections.git
git push origin master : Push the master commit into "origin" remote
git pull origin master : Pull from the origin to update local master
